/// changed the state of the tree, because the iterable returned by
/// this function caches the results and only walks the tree once.
///
/// The same applies to any iterable obtained indirectly through this
/// one, for example the results of calling `where` on this iterable

/// [Element.visitChildren] does not guarantee order, but does guarantee stable
/// order. This iterator also guarantees stable order, and iterates in a left
/// to right order:
///
///       1
///     /   \
///    2     3
///   / \   / \
///  4   5 6   7
///
/// Will iterate in order 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7.
///
/// Performance is important here because this method is on the critical path
/// for flutter_driver and package:integration_test performance tests.
/// Performance is measured in the all_elements_bench microbenchmark.
/// Any changes to this implementation should check the before and after numbers
/// on that benchmark to avoid regressions in general performance test overhead.
///
/// If we could use RTL order, we could save on performance, but numerous tests
/// have been written (and developers clearly expect) that LTR order will be
/// respected.
