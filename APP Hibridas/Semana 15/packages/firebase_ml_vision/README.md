> **This package is now discontinued** since these APIs are no longer available in the latest Firebase SDKs.
> As an alternative you can switch to Google's standalone ML Kit library via [google_ml_kit](https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_kit)
> for on-device vision APIs. For calling the Cloud Vision API from your app the recommended approach is using Firebase
> Authentication and Functions, which gives you a managed, serverless gateway to Google Cloud Vision APIs. For an example
> Functions project see the [vision-annotate-images](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/vision-annotate-images) sample project.
