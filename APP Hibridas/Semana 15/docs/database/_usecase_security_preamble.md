Note: By default, read and write access to your database is restricted so only
authenticated users can read or write data. To get started without setting up
Firebase Authentication, you can [configure your rules for public access](/docs/rules/basics#default_rules_locked_mode).
This does make your database open to anyone, even people not using your app, so
be sure to restrict your database again when you set up authentication.
